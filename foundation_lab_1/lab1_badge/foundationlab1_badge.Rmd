The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts:

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of one of the data structures we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Campos, F. C., Ahn, J., DiGiacomo, D. K., Nguyen, H., & Hays, M. (2021). Making sense of sensemaking: Understanding how K--12 teachers and coaches react to visual analytics. Journal of Learning Analytics, 8(3), 60--80. <https://doi.org/10.18608/jla.2021.7113>

2.  What types of data are associated with LA ?

    -   survey data, interview data, numerical data, text data,

3.  What type of data structures are analyzed in the educational context?

    -   PMs are collected through student-facing surveys, think aloud sessions, semi-structures interviews with teachers and coaches. Data visuals of student graphs for teachers and coaches

4.  How might this article be used to better understand a dataset or educational context of personal or professional interest to you?

    -   They worked with teachers and coaches to understand to support sensemaking of learning analytics data. It is important to acknowledge that teachers may not know how to process or use the data they are given. This makes me think of how strategic professional development and coaching can support utilizing these tools.

5.  Finally, how do these processes compare with what teachers and educational organizations already do to support and assess student learning?

    -   LA Process Model - Instructional Event, Data Representation, Awareness, Reflection & Insight, Pedagogical Action

Draft a research question of guided by techniques and data sources that you are potentially interested in exploring in more depth.

1.  What data source(s) should be analyzed or discussed?

    -   Teacher responses to professional development overall. Progression of concept understanding before and after PD, then after coaching. Responses to pedagogy used in PD and if it is transferable to classroom.

2.  What is the purpose of your article?

    -   To inform PD pedagogy and topics in PD sessions, Track understanding of concepts across sessions.

3.  Explain the analytical level at which these data would need to be collected and analyzed.

    -   survey responses and interviews with teachers attending PD series

4.  How, if at all, will your article touch upon the application(s) of LA to "understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?"

    -   LA will help use develop better PD and we can also develop PD to share grater understanding of LA data outputs. We can also see if we are building conceptual understanding.

### Part II: Data Product

After you finish the script file for [lab1_badge](https://github.com/laser-institute/foundational-skills/tree/master/foundation_lab_1/lab1_badge) add the code fo reach problem into the correct code chunks below. \# Making sure not to change the code chunk name.

```{r, problem_1}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
Students <- c("Thor", "Rogue", "Electra", "Electra", "Wolverine")
Foods <- c("Bread", "Orange", "Chocolate", "Carrots", "Milk")

data<-data.frame(Students, Foods)
data

```

```{r, problem_2}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
data_table<-table(Students)
data_table

```

```{r, problem_3}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
num<- c(2,3,7,9,10)
numsum<-sum(num)
numsum

```

```{r, problem_4}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

sci_classes<- read_csv(here("data/sci-online-classes.csv"))
sci_classes
#A tibble: 603 X 30

head(sci_classes)
#A tibble: 6 X 30

```

```{r, problem_5}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
sci_select<- select(sci_classes, -subject, -section)
sci_select
head(sci_select)


```

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Data Sources Badge!

*Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by:*

1.  Change the name of the author: in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4.  Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692): Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account. Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).

5.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [Foundations Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/foundations/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and `write` a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
